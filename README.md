Team Meetings

# Your group will meet with me multiple times to discuss your progress with your project. During each meeting you will:

Give a live demo of your system.
Describe accomplishments for each team member
Determine next steps
Discuss any issues you are having (technological or team)
Presentation

# During the last week of class and during the final exam period, each team will present on their work. Your presentation should be about 10 minutes long and should include:
